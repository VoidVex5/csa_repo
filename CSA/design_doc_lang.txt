Project name: Hisar Programming Language for the Rasberry Pi Pico
Language Name: [TBA]
Description: A systems programming language designed specifically for the Rasberry Pi Pico. Characteristics of the language will be its low SRAM requiremnt, small binaries, orthonogality, and manual memory management. Syntax will be similar to C, with some quality of life changes. The compiler will be based on LLVM for simplicity but it might be self hosted if it can be managed. While designed specifically for Rasberry Pi Pico, it should be able to work for all chips with ARMv6-M architecture.

rough example:

#include <std>
